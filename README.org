* Emacs configuration files

** Structure
Basic configuration is in init.el and config specific to certain packages, modes is in _custom/init-*.el_.

*** Org-mode
org-mode configuration files are in custom/init-org*.el. 

** CREDITS
Many parts of this config have come from package manuals, docs and other emacs-config files, so crediting the source isn't really possible.
